/**
 * Credential provider that is a wrapper over and uses pravega credentials to authenticate to schema registry.
 * This is to be used if users want to use the same credentials to authenticate to schema registry 
 * that they have used in pravega client.
 * This can be achieved in one of two ways - 
 * 1. instantiate this class with Pravega client config and this will extract credentials from the client config. 
 * 2. instantiate this class without any credentials and it will extract credentials from the environment
 * by creating a default clientconfig which loads the credentials from the environment variables or system properies. 
 * Refer to {@link ClientConfig} to see how credentials are loaded from the environment.
