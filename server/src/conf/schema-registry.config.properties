## Instructions for using this file:
# 1. Settings are namespaced. The prefix indicates the component for which the configuration applies.
# 2. All settings have default values hardcoded inside the code. The purpose of this file is to provide Environment Variable
#    references so that they may fetch values via such an indirection.
# 3. Each of these settings can be overridden from the command like by specifying a Java System Property.
# Example: setting 'controller.service.port' has a default value of "tcp://localhost:9090", but it can be overridden to a different
#          value via the command-line:
#                java -Dservice.controller.url="tcp://10.10.10.10:9090" ...
#          which will set the value for that setting to "tcp://10.10.10.10:9090", regardless of what this file contains.
