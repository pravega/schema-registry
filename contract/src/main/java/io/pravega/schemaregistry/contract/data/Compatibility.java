/**
 * Defines different Compatibility policy options for schema evolution for schemas within a group.
 * The choice of compatibility policy tells the Schema Registry service whether a schema should be accepted to evolve
 * into new schema by comparing it with one or more existing versions of the schema. 
 * 
 * {@link Type#AllowAny}: allow any changes to schema without any checks performed by the registry. 
 * {@link Type#DenyAll}: disables any changes to the schema for the group.
 * {@link Type#Backward}: a new schema can be used to read data written by previous schema. 
 * {@link Type#BackwardTransitive}: a new schema can be used read data written by any of previous schemas. 
 * {@link Type#BackwardTill}: a new schema can be used to read data written by any of previous schemas till schema 
 * identified by version {@link Compatibility#backwardTill}. 
 * {@link Type#Forward}: previous schema can be used to read data written by new schema. 
 * {@link Type#ForwardTransitive}: all previous schemas can read data written by new schema. 
 * {@link Type#ForwardTill}: All previous schemas till schema identified by version {@link Compatibility#forwardTill}
 * can read data written by new schema. 
 * {@link Type#Full}: both backward and forward compatibility.
 * {@link Type#FullTransitive}: both backward and forward compatibility with all previous schemas.
