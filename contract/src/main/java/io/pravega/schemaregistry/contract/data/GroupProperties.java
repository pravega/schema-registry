/**
 * Different configuration choices for a group. 
 * 
 * {@link GroupProperties#serializationFormat} identifies the serialization format used to describe the schema.
 * {@link GroupProperties#compatibility} sets the schema validation policy that needs to be enforced for evolving schemas.
 * {@link GroupProperties#allowMultipleTypes} that specifies if multiple schemas with distinct {@link SchemaInfo#type} 
 * are allowed to coexist within the group. A schema describes an object and each object type is distinctly identified by
 * {@link SchemaInfo#type}. Registry service validates new schema with existing schema versions of the same name and versions
 * it accordingly. Allowing multiple schemas, each versioned independently, allows applications to use schema registry groups
 * for streaming scenarios like event sourcing, or message bus where different types of events could be written to the same
 * stream. Similarly, a group with multiple schemas can be used to describe a database catalog with each schema representing 
 * a different table. 
 * The users can register new versions of each distinct type of schema, and the registry will check for compatibility 
 * for each type independently.
 * {@link GroupProperties#properties} This is general purpose key value string to include any additional user defined information for the group.
